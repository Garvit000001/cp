	// map implementattion takes place by red tree so it takes O(log N) time in every case generally 

	//difference in between the two is we cannot use some datatype as key in unordered_map for eg pair,set,vector as key as it will try to convert it in hash by using hash funciton for pair jo hota hi nhi hai but in map we can use as it will compare in red tree which is possible
